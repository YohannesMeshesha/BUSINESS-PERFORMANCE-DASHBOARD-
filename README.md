I am pleased to present the Business Performance dashboard that I have developed using Power BI. Power BI is a business analytics service provided by Microsoft that allows you to analyze data and share insights.

In developing this dashboard, I followed the ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) process to ensure that the data is clean, accurate, and usable. The first step was to extract the data from various sources, such as spreadsheets, databases, and cloud services. Once the data was extracted, I performed data cleansing to remove any inconsistencies, such as missing data, duplicate entries, and incorrect values. The next step was to transform the data into a usable format by performing operations such as merging, splitting, and aggregating. Finally, I loaded the data into Power BI, where I created the visualizations and analyzed the data.

The Business Performance dashboard that I have developed is designed to provide a detailed analysis of your business performance. It includes various metrics such as sales, gross sales, COGS, and profit, among others. The dashboard is interactive, user-friendly, and can be customized to suit your specific business needs.

The Top 3 Products in Each Segment by Unit Sold table is a great way to analyze the performance of your products, and the Total Profit by Country visualization provides valuable insights into the profitability of different countries. The 2013 - 2014 Sales by Country clustered bar chart is another valuable visualization that provides insight into the sales performance of different countries. The dashboard also includes a slicer that allows users to filter the data by country, discount band, product, and year.

In conclusion, This Business Performance dashboard that I have developed using Power BI will provide valuable insights into business's performance. The dashboard is a powerful tool that can be used to monitor your sales, profitability, and product performance and make informed decisions based on the data you gather.
